Dissidia Duodecim Final Fantasy DLC Toolkit

Hi everyone!
This is a very simple DLC Toolkit for Dissidia Duodecim: Final Fantasy!

Requirements:
- .NET Framework 4.0 (Should be compatible from Windows XP SP3 onwards)

Changelog:
- 1/5/2015  -	Version 1.0
    - Ported all existing code from JRuby to .NET (that's why I jumped to v1.0 :P)
    - DLC Generation tab:
        - Added Normal, Alt.1 & Alt.2 options for all characters that support them
        - Added more character-specific security checks (ex: Aerith can only use Normal, Alt.1 & Alt.2 costume slots)
    - Support for creating & linking DLC attachments
    - DLC Reporter tab:
        - Now reports .objx files' names for easier extraction
        - Minor improvements in Excel spreadsheet formatting
    - Added log file for easier bug reporting
    - Code uploaded to GitHub
